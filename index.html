          Asian Cucumber Salad
          <br />
          <ul>
            Ingredients: thin-skinned cucumbers (English, Turkish, Persian),
            salt, rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce or liquid amino acids,
            maple syrup (or honey), garlic, ginger, chili, paste
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ul>
            Process: So if you have time, salt the cucumbers, and place in a
            strainer– for 20 minutes or up to a few hours! Chop up your herbs.
            Here I’m simply using scallions, but feel free to play with chives,
            cilantro, or even Thai basil! You can directly add these to the
            salad bowl with the strained cucumbers and toss. Simple! Grate a
            little ginger into the salad. Grate a little garlic into the bowl.
            For a little heat- add Red chili paste or sriracha. The Asian
            Cucumber Salad will last 3 days in the fridge- if it makes it that
            long!
